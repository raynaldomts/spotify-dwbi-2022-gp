# DASHBOARD SPOTIFY
This project involves the development of a Data Mart and Dashboard for Spotify, aiming to streamline the data presentation and analysis process. The process begins with collecting data from staging sources with the goal of managing and merging data to ensure data accuracy. Following a thorough data analysis, I proceed with creating a Data Mart to fulfill specific objectives and benefits. Subsequently, I embark on dashboard creation to facilitate decision-making. I utilize a dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maltegrosse/8-m-spotify-tracks-genre-audio-features. 
This project is undertaken by Raynaldo Silalahi.
